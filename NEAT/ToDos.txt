comment NEAT

Note:
	- preferSimilarFactor removed now that Species are introduced
	- crossover_singlepoint not implemented (can lead to disconnected networks and doesn't seem trivial how to fix that), plus NEAT almost always uses it as 0


 - check OneNote notes
 - use Rand that myke added in his GameFramework -> global Rand
 - check video about random generator that Myke sent me

 - put 'Rand' inside namespace


  - if I ever do HyperNEAT, remember to include 'distance' and not only 'x' and 'y' (from http://blog.otoro.net/2015/07/31/neurogram/)
